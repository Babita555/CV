        <p>Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. 
           Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, 
           to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions.
           Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of the cooks. Cooking is done both by people in 
           their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments.</p>

        <p>Dance is a performing art form consisting of sequences of movement, either improvised or purposefully selected. 
           This movement has aesthetic and often symbolic value.[nb 1] Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography,
           by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.</p>

        <p>Sleeping well directly affects your mental and physical health. Fall short and it can take a serious toll on your daytime 
           energy, productivity, emotional balance, and even your weight. Yet many of us regularly toss and turn at night, struggling 
           to get the sleep we need.</p>
